* Hardware Test
* Electricity Test
* Software Test
* Durability Test
* Usability Test

## 1.2 Catastrophic Failure
### Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it? 

The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in 1982 after the Therac-6 and Therac-20 units (the earlier units had been produced in partnership with CGR of France). It was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses of radiation, approximately 100 times the intended dose. These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems, and they have become a standard case study in health informatics and software engineering. The software was written in assembly language for a custom CPU.
